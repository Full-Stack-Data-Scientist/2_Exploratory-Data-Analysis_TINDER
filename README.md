#  __Project__ ðŸš§

The marketing team needs help on a new project. They are experiencing a decrease in the number of matches, and they are trying to find a way to understand what makes people interested into each other.

They decided to run a speed dating experiment with people who had to give Tinder lots of informations about themselves that could ultimately reflect on ther dating profile on the app.

Tinder then gathered the data from this experiment. Each row in the dataset represents one speed date between two people, and indicates wether each of them secretly agreed to go on a second date with the other person.
